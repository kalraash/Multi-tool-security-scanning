Option 1: Scanning with the Web Version of Snyk
This is useful for one-time or ad-hoc scans from the Snyk dashboard.

Step 1: Sign Up and Log In
Go to https://snyk.io.

Sign up or log in using GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or email.

Step 2: Connect Your Git Repository
Navigate to Projects > Add Project.

Choose your Git provider (e.g., GitHub).

Authorize Snyk to access your repositories.

Step 3: Select Repositories to Scan
Choose one or more repositories you want Snyk to monitor.

Snyk will automatically detect manifest files such as:

package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.

IaC files like Dockerfile, terraform.tf, kubernetes.yaml

Step 4: Scan the Project
Click on the repository name from the project list.

Snyk will display issues under:

Open Source vulnerabilities

Code (SAST) issues

IaC misconfigurations

Step 5: Monitor and Fix
View CVEs, severity, and remediation advice.

Use Ignore, Fix PR, or Upgrade options.

Snyk will continuously monitor the repo and alert you of new vulnerabilities.


Option 2: Scanning with Snyk GitHub Actions (CI/CD Workflow)
This is ideal for automated security scanning on every push or PR.

Step 1: Create a Snyk API Token
Log into Snyk and go to Account Settings > API Token.

Copy the token.

Step 2: Add the API Token to GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.

Add a new secret:

Name: SNYK_TOKEN

Value: Your copied token

Step 3: Add Snyk GitHub Action Workflow
Create a file: .github/workflows/snyk.yml

Use the following code in the workflow:

name: Snyk Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  snyk:
    name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js (optional, adjust for your environment)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Run Snyk to check vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@v1
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          command: test

Step 4: Commit & Push
Commit and push the workflow file.

The scan will run on every push or pull request to main.

Step 5: Review Results
Go to Actions tab in GitHub to view the scan report.

Youâ€™ll see a breakdown of vulnerabilities and suggestions to remediate.
