Step 1: Prerequisites
Your project should be hosted on GitHub.
CodeQL supports several languages: JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C/C++, C#, Ruby, TypeScript.
Repository must have a GitHub Advanced Security license (for private repos) or be public.

Step 2: Enable GitHub Code Scanning
Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on Security > Code scanning alerts.
Click Set up code scanning > Choose "Set up this workflow" under CodeQL Analysis.

Step 3: Customize CodeQL Workflow

name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 5 * * 1' # weekly scan every Monday

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze code with CodeQL
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write  # Required to upload results

    strategy:
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'python' ] # Update based on your codebase
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2


Step 4: 4. View Scan Results
After a scan, results will appear under:
GitHub > Security tab > Code scanning alerts
Alerts include:
CWE category
Severity (Low, Medium, High)
Path to vulnerable code
Recommendations with links to the relevant part of the code

Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring
Use scheduled scans to catch issues that may arise from third-party updates.
Enable PR scanning to block vulnerable code before merge.
Integrate with tools like GitHubâ€™s Dependabot to get a full picture of your software supply chain risks.
