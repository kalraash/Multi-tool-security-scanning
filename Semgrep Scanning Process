Step 1. Create a Semgrep Account and Organization

Go to https://semgrep.dev and sign up (you can use GitHub for quick registration).

After login, create or join an organization within Semgrep to manage scans centrally.

Step 2. Connect GitHub Repositories to Semgrep

This enables Semgrep to monitor repositories and trigger scans from its dashboard.

Steps:
In Semgrep dashboard, go to Settings > Integrations > Code.

Click Connect Repository or Connect GitHub Organization.

Authorize Semgrep’s GitHub App to access your repositories:

Choose either all repos or specific repos.

Once connected, Semgrep will list all authorized repositories.

Click Enable Scanning for each repository you want to scan.

Step 3. Configure Semgrep Rules
Semgrep can use:

Built-in rules (e.g., OWASP Top 10, secrets, cloud misconfigurations).

Community-written rulesets

Custom rules (you can write YAML-based rules tailored to your code)

You can manage rules in:

https://semgrep.dev/r

Or create rules in your own org under Rules > Create Rule

Step 4. Run a Manual Scan from Semgrep UI (Optional)

After integration, click on a connected repository.

Click Scan Now to trigger a scan from the dashboard.

Review findings under Findings tab—categorized by severity, rule, and file path.

CI/CD Integration: Run Semgrep in GitHub Actions

Step 5. Add GitHub Actions Workflow for Semgrep
You can run Semgrep automatically during pull requests or pushes.

Create: .github/workflows/semgrep.yml

name: Semgrep Scan

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  semgrep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python (required by Semgrep)
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install Semgrep
        run: |
          pip install semgrep

      - name: Run Semgrep scan
        run: |
          semgrep --config auto

Optional: Upload Results to Semgrep Cloud Platform
To view results in the Semgrep dashboard (hosted service):

Get your Semgrep App Token:

Go to Settings > Organization > App Tokens

Create and copy the token.

Add token to GitHub:

Go to GitHub Repo > Settings > Secrets > Actions

Add:

Name: SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN

Value: your token

Modify workflow to upload scan results:

      - name: Run Semgrep with cloud upload
        run: |
          semgrep ci
        env:
          SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
