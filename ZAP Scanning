Step 1: Prerequisites
OWASP ZAP installed on your machine:
Download: https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
Desktop app with an exposed API or local web interface.
Java installed (ZAP runs on Java).
(Optional) Postman or cURL to replay API traffic.

Step 2: Launch ZAP and Configure Proxy
Start OWASP ZAP GUI.
Go to:
Tools > Options > Local Proxy
Confirm default is set to:
Address: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8080
Set your desktop app (or browser if it uses webview) to route all HTTP/S traffic through this proxy:
For browsers: Set proxy manually to localhost:8080
For API clients: Use http://127.0.0.1:8080 as proxy

Step 3: Interact with Your Desktop App
Run the app and perform typical user/API operations.
ZAP will capture and record all requests and responses via its Sites tab.
It builds a site tree of all endpoints discovered (GET, POST, etc.).

Step 4: Explore the API (Optional)
If your desktop app has a Swagger/OpenAPI spec or Postman collection:
Option A: Import API Definition
Go to Import > Import OpenAPI/Swagger or Import > Import Postman Collection.
Provide the local or remote file/URL.
ZAP will pre-populate the target API structure.
Option B: Manual API Exploration
Use API client (e.g., Postman/cURL) to hit endpoints while ZAP is proxying.
ZAP will record all traffic in the History and Sites panel.

Step 5: Configure Active Scan
In ZAP, right-click the target domain or IP under the Sites tree.
Choose Attack > Active Scan.
Configure the scan:
Target: The API base URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
Select relevant scan policies:
XSS
SQLi
Command Injection
CSRF
Server misconfigurations
Click Start Scan.

Step 6: Monitor Scan Progress and Results
Active scanning may take a few minutes depending on API size.
Results will populate in:
Alerts Tab: Lists vulnerabilities found (with severity).
History Tab: Shows all scanned requests/responses.
Each alert includes:
Vulnerability type
Severity (High, Medium, Low)
Affected URL
Suggested remediation


Step 7: Generate a Security Report
Go to Report > Generate Report > Choose format: HTML, XML, Markdown.
Reports include:
Summary of vulnerabilities
Request/response samples
CWE references

Optional: Automate with ZAP CLI or Docker (Headless Scan)
For repeatable scans, you can run ZAP via CLI or Docker:
Example CLI Command: zap.sh -cmd -quickurl http://localhost:3000 -quickout zap_report.html
Docker Example: docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -i owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:3000 -r zap_report.html
